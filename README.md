With registration users are able to have a personalized display name and avatar, friend other registered users, and look at their game history and statistics.

## Instructions
Prerequisites:
- Docker installed in your PC
- .env files where there are env.example files

Clone the project then run `docker compose up` in the root of the repository. 
## Team Information

## Project management
We organized ourselves through a Whatsapp group chat where we shared our advancements and where we coordinated for meetings and tasks.

At first we had a scheduled video call, specially because all team memebers had other responsabilities outside the project, but once the project was more advanced we slowed the meetings up for more specific coordination.

In the docs folder we have some other documents that were useful in managing the project.
